/**
 * Solution for LeetCode problem #121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock.
 * <p>
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a
 * different day in the future to sell that stock.
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
